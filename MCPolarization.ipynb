Since we aligned the axisymmetry axis along the $z$, we have that $\\cos(i) = v_z$, or $\\sin^2(i)=1-v_z^2$.  $\\sin^2(i)$ goes from 0 to 1, so we can pick $n_{\\sin^2(i)}$ bins and put each photon into the appropiate one: $n = \\mathrm{int}[n_{\\sin^2(i)}*(1-v_z^2)]$, which will give integers between 0 and n_{\\sin^2(i)}-1 (note $\\mathrm{int}[\\ldots]$ here mean the floor function, or casting, rounding down to the nearest integer).\n",
